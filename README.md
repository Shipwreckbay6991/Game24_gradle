# Math24 Combinations Computing Algorithm

## What is Math24
Math24 is a simple number game. Players get 4 random numbers between 1 and 13, players need to use these 4 numbers to constitute a math exprssion, which evaluates to 24. 
Each number can only be used once.

Simple example:
Numbers: 2, 3, 6, 8
Valid expression: (3*6)+8-2

## What does this algorithm do
This repository is an algorithm based on Java to produce all possible unique combinations, also validate and filter them. 
The whole algorithm simulates player view, thus is not the most efficient way, but provides an interesting perspective.
